# ESP-DOOM
Doom on ESP32

My adaptation of Espressif's PrBoom port modified by [jkirsons](https://github.com/jkirsons/doom-espidf) and [Veenkar](https://github.com/Veenkar/doom-espidf). This adaptation modifies hardware-specific code to run DOOM in the [ESP-DOOM](https://github.com/VinnieT1/ESP-DOOM) board.
